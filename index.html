  <h2><center>  Augmented Reality Quiz  </center></h2>
  <h2 style = "font-size:25px" ><center> <strong><u>ABSTRACT </u> </strong>  </center> </h2> 
  <div class = "myDiv"><p style = "font-size:20px" "color:aqua"> The AR Quiz using Open CV and Gesture Recognition is a UI-based application for students and
  teachers to easily make and use an Augmented Reality system. AR as a platform is just now
  reaching its full potential. Since smartphones and mobile devices are now at a sufficiently large
  user base, it is worth looking at the potential for an extremely small form factor delivery system
  that is flexible, easily modified, and can be used by educators and students. An easily modifiable
  AR learning experience will present an AR Mobile platform development, interactive museums,
  and the chosen subject in a new style.  The Quizzes in this project can be shown to improve not
  only knowledge of the chosen subject through investigation, but a better understanding of the
  development potentials and knowledge of the mobile devices now ubiquitous to students.
  In the AR Quiz using Open CV and Gesture Recognition, the user can log in and select a quiz in
  which he/she wants to examine his/her intelligence.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> When the camera opens, depending on the
  quiz, and what type of questions are there in the database, the camera will show the first question
  and its UI will appear on the screen as an overlay that is, the image will be superimposed on the
  background and the questions appear on the screen randomly. The Hand Gesture Recognition
  system works in the background and it captures all the hand movements and detects all the gestures
  and movements of the finger coordinates. When the user selects an option using two fingers, the
  option gets selected and if the answer is correct, the score is added to the database of the user.
  There can be different user profiles and admin profiles. The user can launch and use the UI-based
  application. The administration system can add more questions of different categories which can
  be administered by the admin. It will be very user interactive and hence will be found interesting
  by the students to learn in this way.
  The use of Augmented reality and Headsets in future will be more common for gaming,
  entertainment and education purposes as the Metaverse is gaining popularity these days. It is
  useful for students who want to learn new things like children in Play-school and Kindergarten.
  The children will be very much curious to learn new things in this way.</span>

  <p id="intr">  "None of us, including me, ever do great things. But we can all do small things, with great love,
  and together we can do something wonderful." – Mother Teresa.
  Augmented Reality (AR) is a combination of a real and a computer-generated or virtual world. It
  is achieved by augmenting computer-generated images in the real world. Augmented reality is the
  integration of digital information with the user's environment in real-time. Unlike virtual reality
  (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a real-world
  environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it. It is of four types namely
  marker-based, markerless, projection based and superimposition-based augmented reality.
  Augmented reality comes under the field of mixed reality. It can be considered as an inverse
  reflection of Virtual Reality.</br><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
  A hand gesture recognition system provides a natural, innovative and modern way of nonverbal
  communication. Hand gesture recognition is one of the most viable and popular solutions for
  improving human-computer interaction. In recent years it has become very popular due to its use
  in gaming devices like Xbox, PS4, and other devices like laptops, smartphones, etc. Hand gesture
  recognition has been used in various applications like medicine, accessibility support, etc.
  Flask is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features
  that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more
  accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using
  only a single Python file. Flask framework will be used in the front-end technology of our project.
  OpenCV stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library and is an open-source computer vision
  and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for
  computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial
  products. Computer Vision means the extraction of information from images, text, videos, etc.
  Sometimes computer vision tries to mimic human vision. It’s a subset of computer-based
  intelligence or Artificial intelligence which collects information from digital images or videos and
  analyzes them to define the attributes.</br>
  Computer vision works in three basic steps:</br>
  1. Acquiring an image:</br>
  Images, even large sets, can be acquired in real-time through video, photos or 3D
  technology for analysis.</br>
  2. Processing the image:</br>
  Deep learning models automate much of this process, but the models are often trained by
  first being fed thousands of labeled or pre-identified images.</br>
  3. Understanding the image:</br>
  The final step is the interpretative step, where an object is identified or classified.
  Scope of Augmented Reality
  Augmented Reality has the potential to be used in almost every industry, including:</br>
  
  1. Education:</br>
  Augmented Reality is replacing traditional methods and introducing creative ways to learn. AR
  motivates students to engage, interact and increase the ability of students to learn curricular.</span>

  2. Military:</br>
  The military has been devising uses for augmented reality for decades. The idea here is that an
  augmented-reality system could provide troops with vital information about their surroundings,
  such as showing where entrances are on the opposite end of a building, somewhat like X-ray
  vision.</br> 3. GamingAugmented reality is a combination of game visuals along with the audio content with respect to
  the user environment in real-time which helps in the establishment of an artificial environment.AR
  is used to create a playing zone within the existing artificial environment.</br>
  4. Repair & MaintenanceWhether it's a car motor or an MRI machine, repair and maintenance staff are beginning to use
  AR headsets and glasses while they provide useful information on the spot, suggest potential fixes,
  and point out potential trouble areas.

    <h3><b>Hand gesture recognition on Python and OpenCV by Ahmad Paul Ismail</b></h3>
  <p>
  Hand gesture recognition is one of the systems that can detect the gesture of a hand in a real-time 
  video. The gesture of hand is classified within a certain area of interest. This project concentrates 
  on how a system could detect, recognize and interpret hand gesture recognition through computer 
  vision with the challenging factors which are variability in the pose, orientation, location and 
  scale. To perform well in developing this project, different types of gestures such as numbers and 
  sign languages are created in the system.

      <h3><b>Augmented reality in Construction‟ by Shakil Ahmad:</b></h3>
      <p>
  Augmented reality in construction may be leveraged to help firms win more projects, improve 
  safety and collaborate with team members.AR refers to experiences and technologies that bring 
  computer-generated objects into a physical environment, like augmented reality glasses for 
  construction. The benefits of Augmented Reality in construction industry are manifold. 
  Although the costs for this forward-looking technology are still high, they are becoming 
  increasingly lower. Therefore, it is foreseeable that small to medium-sized companies will soon 
  also be able to invest in this way of working.</p>
